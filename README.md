# BBS-Menu-Color-Scheme-Creator-20-Winserver-Update
 This is a new update for Winserver 8.0454.10 or below.

Hello everyone: I am including all versions that I have worked on back to version 17, for reference point only. If you want to use this software install version 20 as it is the most up to date version and it works fully. No seperate colors for inner boxes yet, I am working on that , it will take some time , but i do have other projects that take priority like my Atari Portfolio Mass Media Shell, available here. 

On another note i am just learning C, for the Atari Portfolio so I might tackle this project in a couple of weeks, unless someone finds a major bug, and I will release the same version in my Quick Basic 64 version.......have fun with it.
